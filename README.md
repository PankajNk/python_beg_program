This are python program to understand basic

1)Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
Enter your name: Chuck
Hello Chuck

2)Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25

3)Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to
Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.

4) Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17 height = 12.0
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the
expression).
1. width//2
2. width/2.0
3. height/3
4. 1 + 2 * 5

5) Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above
40 hours.
Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 10
Pay: 475.0

6) Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input
gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the
program:
Enter Hours: 20
Enter Rate: nine
Error,
please enter numeric input Enter

7) Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error
message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
